**Project Aurelius - Who's Already Building This?**

> **Status:** Living Document  
> **Laatste Update:** Februari 2026  
> **Doel:** Eerlijke analyse van concurrenten, substitutes, en adjacent players

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**De ongemakkelijke waarheid:** We zijn NIET de eersten die dit probleem zien.

**Categorieën van concurrentie:**

1. **Direct Concurrenten** (doen exact wat wij doen)
   - Status: **Geen** (nog niet)
   - Risico: **Medium** (kunnen elk moment verschijnen)

2. **Adjacent Players** (doen delen van onze oplossing)
   - Status: **~10 bedrijven** wereldwijd
   - Risico: **High** (kunnen hun scope uitbreiden)

3. **Substitute Threats** (lossen probleem op andere manier op)
   - Status: **Actief** (energiebedrijven, big tech)
   - Risico: **Very High** (verticale integratie)

4. **Potential Acquirers** (zouden ons kunnen kopen OF doden)
   - Status: **Watching** (innovation hubs, pilots)
   - Risico: **Medium** (afhankelijk van onze snelheid)

**Bottomline:** We hebben een 18-24 maanden first-mover window. Daarna komt de stampede.

## 🏢 TIER 1: Direct Concurrenten (Agent Payment Infrastructure)

### Niemand (Yet) ❌

**Goede Nieuws:**
- Geen enkele startup claimt: "We zijn de payment rails voor AI agents"
- Geen VC fund heeft dit publiek gemaakt als thesis
- Geen big tech heeft dit aangekondigd

**Slecht Nieuws:**
- Dit betekent OF: We zijn visionary (slim)
- OF: Er is geen markt (dom)
- OF: Het is te vroeg (timing risk)

**Reality Check:**

Kijk naar vergelijkbare "infrastructure for new economy" plays:

| Company | Founded | First Competitor | Time to Stampede |
|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Stripe** (payments API) | 2010 | Square, Adyen al actief | 3 years to Braintree, PayPal copy |
| **Twilio** (comms API) | 2008 | Plivo (2011), Nexmo (2010) | 2 years |
| **Auth0** (identity) | 2013 | Okta, Ping Identity al actief | 1 year to new entrants |
| **AWS** (cloud infra) | 2006 | Azure (2010), GCP (2008) | 2-4 years |

**Pattern:** 18-36 maanden tot eerste echte concurrent verschijnt.

**Verwachte Timeline voor Aurelius:**

```
2026 Q1: We lanceren (Ground Zero pilot)
2026 Q2-Q4: Nobody notices (too small)
2027 Q1-Q2: First PR, TechCrunch article
2027 Q3-Q4: First competitor appears
  → Likely from: US (YC startup) or China (state-backed)
2028 Q1: Stampede begins
  → Banks launch agent banking
  → Big tech enters (Microsoft, Google)
  → European competitors (Berlin, Stockholm)
```

**Our Advantage (First-Mover):**

- Regulatory relationships (DNB, ECB) - takes 12+ months to build
- Partner lock-in (contracts with TSOs, energy cos)
- Data moat (transaction history = training data for AI)
- Brand (first = best in deep-tech)

**How to Maintain Lead:**

- ✅ **Speed:** 10k agents by EOY 2027 (before competitors launch)
- ✅ **Depth:** Layer 0.5 moats (Oracle, Ricardian, Resource) - hard to copy
- ✅ **Lock-in:** 5-year contracts with partners

**Kans dat direct concurrent ons verslaat: 20%** (low, if we execute fast)

## 🎯 Competitive Positioning Matrix

### Where We Fit

```
                    High Specialization (Agent-Only)
                              │
                              │    🎯 AURELIUS
                              │
                              │
──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────
                              │
  General Payments            │            Energy-Only
  (Adyen, Stripe)             │            (Sonnen, Tesla)
                              │
                              │
                    Low Specialization (Multi-Purpose)
```

**Our Unique Position:**
- Too specialized for payment companies (they won't focus)
- Too payment-focused for energy companies (not their expertise)
- **Sweet spot: Agent payment infrastructure for physical economy**

---

## 🛡️ Our Competitive Moats (How We Stay Alive)

### 1. **Regulatory Moat** (18-24 months)

**What It Is:**
- DNB approval / Innovation Hub exemption
- ECB Digital Euro early access
- AI Act compliance framework

**Why It Protects Us:**
- Takes 12-24 months for competitor to replicate
- Requires relationships (can't just throw money at it)
- First-mover advantage (regulators pick winners)

**How to Maintain:**
- Quarterly check-ins with DNB, ECB, AFM
- Publish compliance playbooks (thought leadership)
- Help write regulation (expert witness status)

**Expiry Date: 2028** (after that, everyone has approval)

---

### 2. **Data Moat** (Compounds Over Time)

**What It Is:**
- Transaction history (millions of data points)
- Agent behavior patterns (what works, what doesn't)
- Market prices (real-time energy, grid balancing)

**Why It Protects Us:**
- More data = better AI optimization
- Better optimization = more customers
- More customers = more data (flywheel)

**How to Maintain:**
- Open data sharing (anonymized, for research)
- Academic partnerships (papers citing our data)
- "Aurelius Index" (de facto standard for agent economy metrics)

**Expiry Date: Never** (compounds forever)

---

### 3. **Network Moat** (Critical Mass = Winner Takes Most)

**What It Is:**
- 2-sided marketplace (agents + energy companies)
- More agents = more attractive for suppliers
- More suppliers = more attractive for agents

**Why It Protects Us:**
- First to 10k agents wins (critical mass)
- Late entrants can't bootstrap (chicken-egg problem)

**How to Maintain:**
- Grow FAST (10k agents by EOY 2027)
- Exclusive partnerships (lock-in energy cos)
- Switching costs (agent retraining is painful)

**Expiry Date: 2028** (after that, market is mature)

---

### 4. **Technical Moat** (Layer 0.5 - The Uncopiables)

**What It Is:**

**a) Universal Oracle Network**
- Decentralized (no single owner)
- Neutral (banks can't control it)
- Cross-border (works in all 27 EU countries)

**Why Uncopiable:**
- Requires neutral governance (banks/energy cos have conflicts)
- Network effects (more nodes = more valuable)
- Trust (first mover = most trusted)

**b) Ricardian Contracts**
- Legal + code in same document
- Enforceable in court + executable by machine
- No one else does this in agent space

**Why Uncopiable:**
- Requires legal + tech expertise (rare combo)
- Liability risk (most companies avoid this)
- First-mover advantage (our templates become standard)

**c) Resource-Based Accounting**
- Multi-asset ledger (kWh, CO2, miles, euros)
- Agents value non-monetary assets
- Physical-digital bridge

**Why Uncopiable:**
- Banks don't think this way (euros only)
- Energy cos don't think this way (kWh only)
- We're the only ones who speak both languages

**Expiry Date: 2030+** (very hard to copy)
